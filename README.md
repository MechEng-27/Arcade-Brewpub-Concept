# Arcade-Brewpub-Concept

## About:
The idea behind this project is creating a conceptual website for a retro gaming themed brewpub. Much of the styling and layout of the page was influnced by the webpage
for Up-Down Milwaukee (https://www.updownarcadebar.com/milwaukee/) but by no means was the project intended to be a 100% clone. 

This was my first truly solo project using React.

Edit (5-20-2024): Website that inspired this project has changed quite a bit.
